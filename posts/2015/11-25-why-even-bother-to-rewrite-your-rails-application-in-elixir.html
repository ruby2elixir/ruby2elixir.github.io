                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>Hey there, I believe that our future as web software development is going to change soon.
There is a lot of ways to write software and I have chosen to write web applications. <strong>My goal is to build my own SaaS business soon and be responsible for it</strong>. When you have that perspective you treat any superficial level of <strong>complexity as unacceptable</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the reason why in 2007 I have learned Ruby and why I wrote my first web applications in Rails. I had to be able to <strong>maintain my applications in the long run</strong>. To peek behind the curtain, I chose a <strong>path of apprenticeship</strong> and joined a then young startup named <strong>DaWanda and watched it grow from 12 people to 200 people</strong>. It grew from a single largish Rails app deployed on 5 dedicated server to a beast of multiple apps with <strong>slow test suites</strong> and <strong>plenty of moving parts</strong>&hellip; To keep the thing running required quite a lot mental effort and it was a dedicated job in itself. You build <strong>abstractions upon abstractions and depend on a hefty amount of third-party libraries just to keep your application alive</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Timeouts, network partitions, lots of small inconsistencies, memory leaks, hanging processes</strong> : it all becomes your daily business.</p>

<p>This is not how I envision my own applications in the future&hellip; They should <strong>fit into my little brain</strong>. They should grow with grace, be maintainable, resource-efficient, provide just the right abstractions to help me in the beginning, but <strong>get out of the way when I&rsquo;m going against recommendations</strong>.</p>

<p>Playing with different languages showed some promise, but the <strong>lost productivity compared to Rails was hard to justify</strong>.</p>

<p>That is until Elixir + Phoenix happened.</p>

<p>It was not an instant insight, rather a slow process. You discover the author&rsquo;s intents while solving small problems, you gather all the small bits of wisdom in discussions, you always ask the same question: &ldquo;Where is the catch? It this too good to be true?&rdquo;. So, I&rsquo;m a <strong>careful &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; into new technogy</strong>, there is just too much &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; happening right now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <strong>in this game for a long run</strong>, so <strong>cutting corners in the beginning only to slow down in the future</strong> is not an option.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t want to buy into the &ldquo;microservices&rdquo; craziness that is all the range right now, you need many teams to compensate the trade-offs of that approach.</p>

<p>I want a technology that will help me to ship products with certain guarantees.</p>

<p>It should:</p>

<ul>
<li>be easily composable</li>
<li><strong>scale vertically</strong></li>
<li><strong>scale horizontally</strong></li>
<li>be reliable</li>
<li>be introspectable</li>
<li>have great tooling</li>
<li>provide <strong>productivity during development</strong></li>
<li>provide <strong>productivity during production</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I am absolutely sure that <strong>Elixir/OTP</strong> is currently <strong>THE ONLY LANGUAGE / PLATFORM</strong> that gives you all that in a nice package.</p>

<p>But it is hard to convince fellow developers when they see their cozy &ldquo;Ruby&rdquo; world threatened. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m totally fine with Rails. It solves my problems and that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well&hellip; The world is evolving. The applications of future demand to be more reliable, more realtime, much faster, cope with much more traffic from many more devices than today.</p>

<p>Rails offers no solution for distributed systems - embrace the <strong>majestic monolith</strong>. No solution for concurrent systems - <strong>background jobs as a poor abstraction</strong> e.g Sidekiq. No reliable solution for realtime systems - <strong>ActionCable is a hack</strong>.</p>

<p>And it is not Rails&rsquo; fault, really. Ruby as a Virtual Machine helps you in the beginning, but <strong>hinders you when your application matures</strong>. When you outgrow that single Rails app. When it&rsquo;s time to break it apart. Be prepared for the <strong>zoo of technologies</strong> just to keep it somehow alive. And let me tell you one thing: you will probably never feel like you control the system.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s ok, you will earn money with it. And Rails is not dying, as some might say.</p>

<p>It just got&hellip; Well&hellip; Old.</p>

<p>Not appropriate for the future we are about to face.</p>

<p>Ambitious, demanding apps require modern tooling and new approaches. The world is realtime.</p>

<p>It is <strong>hard to scale Rails apps and keep quality up</strong>. Usually you&rsquo;ll end up <strong>hiding behind caching</strong>, like MemCached, Redis, Varnish, Fastly&hellip; That&rsquo;s it. And you&rsquo;ll spent a lot of time <strong>ironing all the bugs that occur only in production</strong> and you will have a lot of hard time doing that. You&rsquo;ll have to employ <strong>large teams of developers later in the game to overcome limitation of Rails</strong>. And maybe you&rsquo;ll fine with that, because that is the current state of affairs in the industry. Many decide to <strong>jump ship and build microservice architectures</strong>. But there is <strong>no free lunch</strong> here, you&rsquo;ll still need multiple teams of developers responsible for them. And it certainly requires quite <strong>a lot of unlearning and patience to become even slightly productive with that approach</strong>.</p>

<p>Elixir + Phoenix combo gives you both: <strong>write as monolithic app now, easily split up into several applications later</strong>, use Erlang VM as <strong>operating system to write your application</strong>. Currently there is <strong>no alternative for that approach</strong> that is more elegant and efficient.</p>

<p>Watch this space closely, <strong>Elixir is gaining steam with incredible speed</strong> and will surpass Rails in 2-3 years easily.</p>

<p>Phoenix is <strong>not a clone of Rails</strong>, it is the ultimate combination of years of experience with demanding Rails applications combined into a very <strong>robust, simple, extensible and highly performant package</strong>, standing on shoulders of over 30 years experience building <strong>highly available soft-realtime systems</strong>.</p>

<p>It is very hard to top that.</p>

<p>Think like a professional and <strong>invest in your future now</strong>. Go to <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/learning">http://elixir-lang.org/learning</a> and learn Elixir, you wont regret this decision a single minute. I certainly did not!</p>

<p>Cheers and all the best,
Roman</p>
