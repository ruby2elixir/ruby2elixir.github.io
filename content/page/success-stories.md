### Many By Many:
  [What I learned migrating a Rails app to Elixir/Phoenix](https://medium.com/@stueccles/what-i-learned-migrating-a-rails-app-to-elixir-phoenix-f707436749aa#.uvcx77v8n)

  <blockquote>
  <h3>Summary:</h3>
    So i’m sure there will be many more transition patterns that are useful in migrating a Rails app but so far I’ve found the process not only pretty painless but also feels vastly superior. Not to mention just how much faster the Elixir app is; response times under 100ms bring joy to the heart.
