<p>
Helping fellow Ruby developers to find a quick and painless access to Elixir / Phoenix language / tooling / libraries, all while leveraging currently present Ruby / Rails skills and best practices.
</p>


<p>
  This should be a resource to show your teammates and managers to convince them to give Elixir a try for that new internal / side  / hackathon project you're planning soon.
</p>


<p>
  It's a humble beginning now, but later we want to give free Elixir workshops, collect best learning materials and presentations to really smoothen the dive-in into exciting new opportunities.
  We're actively looking for people wanting to foster Elixir adoption among our team-mates.
