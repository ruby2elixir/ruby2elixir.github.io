This post is for the intermediate / advanced responsible Ruby (Rails) developer who seeks better options to keep her system up and running reliably, code future-proof and her career fun and rewarding.

Recently I came across that question on Stackoverflow:

  http://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/52053/quitting-my-job-over-different-perceptions-on-good-software


This guy wants to leave the team because he feels a real loss of productivity and control due to move towards "micro-services" architecture. The advice he gets is mostly: "Suck it up. Don't be a drama queen. Microservices are the new hot shit and if you're not the architect of the system, you better deal with it."


Why on earth is everybody all over the microservices approach? A quick google search revealed following "success" stories:
